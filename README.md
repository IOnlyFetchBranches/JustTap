  Welcome to JustTap!

    This is just a fun reaction training game I decided to undertake
  a couple days ago for Android!
  It isn't really meant to be unique, but it is quite fun to work on :)

  To get started, open up Android Studio and pull the master branch.
  I've tried to be as detailed as possible with commenting and naming;
  As always if it seems like a lot and you're lost I'd definately read the latest commit messages!

  I'm no UI designer so if it looks a bit ugly, that's because it IS! But I Plan on spicing it up a lot
  once I implement all the features. 

  Don't worry every feature is compartmentalized such that sprucing it up in the future shouldn't be too much of a pain haha

have fun!
